/* NOTICE

MirrorBit flash devices requires 4us from the time    

a programming command is issued before the data polling 

bits can be read.  Without the delay, it is likely

that you will read invalid status from the flash.

The invalid status may lead the software to believe

that programming finished early without problems or 

that programming failed.  If your system has more 

than 4us of delay inherently, you don't need any 

additional delay.  Otherwise, change the #undef to 

a #define

WAIT_4us_FOR_DATA_POLLING_BITS_TO_BECOME_ACTIVE

in lld.h.  Make sure your optimization does not          

remove the delay loop.  You must replace DELAY_4us    

with a value which makes sense for your system.       



It is possible to suspend the erase operation 

with such frequency that it is unable to complete 

the erase operation and eventually times-out.                                            

Change the #undef to #define PAUSE_BETWEEN_ERASE_SUSPENDS 

in lld.h if you are using erase suspend and the 

following is true.

Time between suspends is less that 10 milliseconds    

AND total number of suspends per erase can exceed 5000.         

Make sure that your optimization does not remove the  

delay loop.  You must replace DELAY_10ms with a value 

which make sense in your system.



If you are using MirrorBit devices, change the macro

#undef MIRRORBIT_DEVICE to #define MIRRORBIT_DEVICE.
